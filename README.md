# SearchSharp
### Notice:
This project is on hold for as long as I am involved in the development of [Blair](https://github.com/germanoeich/blair-bot). I have plans to finish this project once time permits. I will not take this down right now because of the working MFT Enumeration, which is hard to come by on the internet and honestly is a pain to get working. Hope this can be of any use in it's current state. Feel free to PR, Fork, etc, just don't expect me to commit for now.

### Description

This is a work-in-progress in the earliest stage.

This library focuses on searching for local content and custom content easily and efficiently. 

### Currently the feature list is:
- MFT (Master File Table) file enumeration for NTFS drives - Mostly done but still needs work

### Things I will implement: 
- File indexing for FAT drives 
- A common file structure to search from
- Multiple search methods 
- Ability to add custom content to the library and have it use the library's search methods 
- Persistence
