# SearchSharp
This is a work-in-progress in the earliest stage.

This library focuses on searching for local content and custom content easily and efficiently. 

### Currently the feature list is:
- MFT (Master File Table) file enumeration for NTFS drives - Mostly done but still needs work

### Things I will implement: 
- File indexing for FAT drives 
- A common file structure to search from
- Multiple search methods 
- Ability to add custom content to the library and have it use the library's search methods 
- Persistence
